## Overview

Welcome to the AI-Based Data Quality Solution repository! This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence to enhance data quality processes, including data cleaning, validation, deduplication, and anomaly detection. By using advanced machine learning algorithms, this solution helps ensure that your data is accurate, consistent, and reliable, leading to better insights and decision-making.

## Features

- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Detect and correct errors in your data with minimal manual intervention.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in your data that may indicate quality issues.
- **Data Deduplication**: Merge duplicate records using AI-powered entity resolution techniques.
- **Predictive Quality Monitoring**: Monitor data quality in real-time and predict potential issues before they occur.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enhance text data quality by correcting language-related issues and extracting key entities.
- **Data Quality Scoring**: Automatically assess and score the quality of your datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pipenv or virtualenv (for managing dependencies)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- A compatible machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure your environment**
   - Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template.
   - Set up necessary environment variables like API keys, database connections, etc.

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage

- **Data Ingestion**: Load your datasets into the system using the provided scripts in the `data_ingestion/` directory.
- **Run Data Quality Checks**: Use the `quality_checks/` module to perform automated data quality checks.
- **Generate Reports**: The `reporting/` module allows you to generate detailed quality reports for your datasets.

### Examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for Jupyter notebooks and sample scripts that demonstrate how to use the solution on various datasets.
